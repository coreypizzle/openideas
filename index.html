<h2>Imagine a world where <em>you</em> shape the web</h2>

<hr><h3>This was once an idea...</h3>

<p>Just like what you plan to publish on this website,
This was an idea.</p>

<p>Just like most great ideas, I thought of it whilst sitting on my phone looking at the
latest web &amp; CSS trends.</p>

<p>I though to myself, who makes these trends you know, trends.
It was <em><strong>us.</strong></em></p>

<p>But of course, not all agree!
Some say that one high-up person makes it and the whole world copies,
sort of like celebrities, they wear skinny jeans, we wear skinny jeans.</p>

<p>Some people aren't the best role models, just because they like something doesn't mean that you do to.</p>

<h3>Ok sure, but what does this website have to do with it?</h3>

<p>Well, everything!</p>

<p>This website is designed so that any member of the community can help others with their website or app ideas and shape the future of the web in general.</p>

<p>For example, I might think of an idea and find it absolutely amazing but others might not!
I would quite like to be prepared for people booing and jeering rather than be all proud and then someone pull me down and tell me it's rubbish.</p>

<p>On this site you upload concepts of your website!
The community (other users like you) then decide whether or not they like it or not.
They can provide constructive-criticism in the form of comments and vote!</p>

<h3>But remember...</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Ideas are meant to be built upon.
Like the foundation of a building,
an idea only is a baseline.
Soon creativity will take over and make a dream into a reality.
Though the idea can only be built on with support.
Like the scaffolding of a building,
the community supports the idea and helps it grow.
Without the community,
ideas would be but a thought.</p>
</blockquote>
